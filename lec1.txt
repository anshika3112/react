    and props, and implementing the virtual DOM diffing algorithm. When you write React components and use JSX syntax, you're essentially using features provided by 
    the React package.
    ReactDOM:The ReactDOM package is responsible for rendering React components in the browser. It provides methods to interact with the DOM (Document Object Model) 
    and manage the mounting and updating of React components within the browser environment.
Q7:What is difference between react.development.js and react.production.js files via CDN?
Ans:The primary difference between the react.development.js and react.production.js files when obtained via a CDN lies in their intended use for development and 
    production environments, respectively. These files are part of the React library, and they are optimized differently to suit different stages of the software 
    development life cycle.
